In written Pattern in this way we can creat object:


public class Test2 {

    public static void main (String[] args){

        Vehicle vehicle1 = new Cars(4, 4,true);
        Vehicle vehicle2 = new Planes(6,200,false);
    }
}










There are many design pattern for this solution. among them here using Factory Design Pattern. here we create a class and use it as a factory for making required object in this way:



class VehicleFactory{
     public Cars getCar(int wheels, int passengers, boolean gas){
         return new Cars(wheels, passengers,gas);
     }
    public Planes getPlane(int wheels, int passengers, boolean gas){
        return new Planes(wheels, passengers,gas);
    }
}

public class Test2_FactoryDesign {

    public static void main (String[] args){

        VehicleFactory factory =new VehicleFactory();

        Vehicle vehicle1 = factory.getCar(4,4,true);
        Vehicle vehicle2 = factory.getPlane(6,200,false);
    }
}
